1.Intro

2.What's an FPGA?
  a. collection of logic blocks (pic of logic block)
    - lookup tables, muxes and flip flops
  b. fast routing connections between them
  c. user configurable ('F' in FPGA)
    -> generally not dynamically reconfigurable (except Tabula)
  d. companies: Xilinx, Altera are the main ones (keep an eye on Tabula)
2a. Why would you want to use an FPGA (maybe this one goes first)
    (vs GPU acceleration)
     - GPUs good for vector ops, but you can't make your own processor with them

3. What's the process of creating an FPGA design?
  a. describe design in HDL code (VHDL, Verilog)
  b. simulate HDL code (GHDL, Icarus are free simulators)
---> proprietary tools from here on:
  b. synthesize design (ISE in Xilinx)
  c. place and route -> bitcode
  d. download bitcode into FPGA

4. What's an HDL?
  a. Hardware Description Language - for modeling your design
  b. two purposes: 
    - Simulation: simulate the hardware to be produced
       (Verification and design exploration as well as timing)
    - Synthesis: describe the hardware to be produced
      (this can be very declarative: BlueSpec, Confluence)
  c. Hardware is highly concurrent
     (VHDL processes)
  d. Examples: VHDL, Verilog, SystemC, BlueSpec, RHDL
  
??  Math: use fixed point

5. Simple example:
  a. serial bit-pattern matcher: captures the next 8 bits if pattern is matched.
